From Stone to Diamond to Distinguished: Shaping an Influential Technology Leader with Community at Heart

Imagine a stone, uncut and rough, filled with potential. Through craftsmanship, it transforms into a diamond, radiating brilliance. Similar to how a diamond symbolizes a pinnacle of transformation, the journey from a college graduate to a Distinguished Engineer signifies the highest point of a technologist's evolution into an influential technology leader.

As we embark this narrative, we'll thread the journey through the lens of a diamond's transformation, while uncovering the attributes that define a Distinguished Engineer

Phase 1: Early Days - Uncovering Potential
My journey began in my junior year, much like an uncut stone. It was during this time that a professor, with whom I had previously collaborated on an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application for her PhD thesis, ignited my passion to join a team that was building  a Telematics solution using GPRS for a leading truck manufacturer. Witnessing the real-time conversion of vehicle coordinates into a comprehensive trip history not only left me amazed but also played a pivotal role in the technological advancement of the truck manufacturer. The program's success not only enhanced the relationship between our college and the manufacturer but also fueled their journey toward greater technological sophistication. As a junior team member, I swiftly emerged as the go-to person, not only addressing project-related queries but also aiding friends with their computer science challenges.

Through this period of exploration and growth, we all navigated together, supporting and learning from each other, culminating in successful placements in renowned companies – a reflection of the diamond's journey from its uncut state to an unpolished gem.

Phase 2: Growth through Experience - Mastering Skills
Transitioning into my professional journey, I found myself on a parallel path of transformation. Just as a diamond cutter refines the stone's edges, my experiences honed my skills and knowledge. Working on distinguished products like CA Service Virtualization and Blazemeter, I nurtured my passion for technology alongside dedicated engineers. 

My transformation gained momentum upon joining the firm as a design authority, where I spearheaded the creation of a firm-wide legal template repository named CDocs. This endeavor provided a unique opportunity to collaborate with passionate engineers across the organization. Much like the synchronization of a well-choreographed performance, I recognized that cohesive microservices could underpin resilient business processes, with events serving as their backbone. Despite initial hesitancy around event-based architecture, I advocated for its benefits and successfully influenced architects and leaders across the firm to implement event-based integration. With this we were able to define a interface to integrate the firm wide legal template repositories, which greatly helped during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify and update the templates that required the customers to visit a branch to sign the executed documents, sparing unnecessary branch visits.

As the maturation of the Photon framework progressed, I harnessed the potential of the CDocs project and took the initiative to evangelize its adoption across the organization. Despite challenges arising from the prevalence of the Moneta framework in other lines of business (LOBs), I showcased Photon's capabilities to our teams in CIB and CB. By highlighting the framework's features that expedited event-based integration, I facilitated its acceptance and integration across LOBs.

During the introduction of the Instant Change Authorization (ICA) process, we got resistance from our stakeholders as they were concerned about the production deployments without business user sign-off through a pre-approved ITSM. I ensured that we automated all the quality checks and demonstrated the end to end ICA deployment flow and secured their confidence and approval. Our team, pioneering within OPT, became the first to deploy to production using ICA right from its initial rollout.

Remaining a strong advocate of event driven architecture, I extended its application to establish an event based integration pattern in the Fulfillment & Archive Services (FAS) product. Through the open source contribution model I contributed to the photon framework in building the event sourcing capabilities using Axon framework. Based on these experience implementing event driven solutions, and the guidance of our architects, I have a developed a design pattern named Event Sourced Queryable State Machine (EQSM). 

Phase 3: Embracing Challenges - Navigating Resilience
 A shift towards data modernization resonated with a diamonds many facets. Recognizing data’s pivotal role in AI, I spearhead implementing our data strategy of making the product data available in the Data Lake for cross product consumption. Navigated a range of obstacles as the Data Pipeline and Data Lake teams concurrently developed their platforms while we executed our solution. Collaborated with numerous senior executives, escalating issues when necessary and obtaining appropriate backing. Successfully pioneered the initial implementation in OPT, enabling the publication of data from the Voice product to the CCB Data Lake.

This journey unfolded against a backdrop of mentorship, community engagement, and leadership. I  have volunteered for POWERUP sessions, Presented in MeetsUp hosted by the firm, Volunteered in cohart trainings and trained engineers to get Certified in AWS. As an Engineering Leader, I built and guided a scrum team during the pandemic, resembling a diamond's resilience amidst challenges.

Phase 4: Multi-Faceted Identity - Radiance of Accomplishments
Now, as a Principal Engineer, my role resembles the facets of a diamond, working with diverse scrum teams to address complex technical challenges. As part of my responsibilities, I orchestrate a bi-weekly Tech Council meeting, uniting all the Lead Developers in various scrum teams. This platform serves as a collaborative space for discussions on technical hurdles, combined proof of concepts across teams, and a forum for showcasing their collective work within the area product. Through this discussions i foster collaboration and engage with the teams to troubleshoot their issues, while defining the technical strategy working with our architects and the product leadership team.

My commitment to community and passion to support and nurtures the next generation, extended to the Tamilnadu Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting underprivileged children in my homeland of Tamilnadu, India. To further this cause, I've actively participated in multiple fundraising events within the Dallas area. Notably, in the previous year (2022), a team of 15 individuals, including myself, undertook a collective fundraiser that resulted in raising an impressive $1.8 million to support children's education. Carrying this momentum into the present year, our efforts continue with a new fundraiser. This initiative aims to aid orphaned children who, due to their circumstances, have made unfortunate decisions and currently reside in correctional facilities, colloquially referred to as schools. Just as a diamond refracts light in a multitude of ways, I aspire to illuminate the lives of these children through educational opportunities and supportive pathways

Phase 5: The Vision of Distinction - A Distinguished Engineer's Brilliance
Each triumph, each revelation, ignited a thirst for growth, resembling the brilliance of a diamond. My passion for technology and community drives me to envision myself as a Technology Leader. The journey is illuminated by mentors and leaders who paved my path, much like a diamond's luster enhanced by careful crafting.

Looking ahead, inspired by the accomplishments of the program’s alumni and the sense of community with in the Expert Engineer Program (E2), I eager to immerse and learn through the various modules offered by the program. As a believer in a nurturing community, I see the E2 community help and foster collaboration among highly driven engineers. Through active participation, I aspire to both learn from and contribute to this thriving community, further develop my leadership attributes through this esteemed program.


To sum up, my journey mirrors how a rough stone turns into a sparkling diamond. Each step is like polishing a new facet. Just as a diamond shines from different angles, my story is full of passion and community care. The Expert Engineer Program (E2) looks like the next step for me. I'm eager to learn from the program's successful graduates and be part of a helpful community. I'm excited about the possibilities. In the future, I want to be a flexible yet strong leader, just like a diamond's sides. I believe I can make a difference by leading in a creative way and being involved in my community. Like a diamond that changes over time, I'm ready to take this chance to grow and shine in the technology world.
