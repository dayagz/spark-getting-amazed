The Event-Sourced Queryable State Machine (EQSM) pattern combines event sourcing, state machines, and SLA tracking to effectively manage business processes. EQSM captures state changes as events, ensures compliance, and enables efficient auditing. State machines provide a structured approach to modeling system states and transitions. SLA tracking allows organizations to monitor and measure state transition times, ensuring adherence to service level agreements. EQSM can leverage machine learning for predictive insights and resource optimization. With EQSM, businesses enhance process management, meet customer expectations, and drive operational excellence.
