Enhancing Resilience and Visibility:
To further enhance the resilience and visibility of the e-commerce business process, EQSM can be extended with additional features:

Event Publication: Publish important state changes, such as "ProcessStarted," "ProcessUpdated," and "ProcessCompleted," as events to a message broker or event stream. This allows other systems or stakeholders to be notified in real-time about the progress and status of the business process.

Alerting and Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively identify delays or issues in the process. Set up thresholds or SLAs and trigger notifications when certain conditions are not met. This enables timely intervention and resolution of any delays or bottlenecks.

Dashboard and Reporting: Develop a centralized dashboard or reporting system that provides a comprehensive view of the e-commerce business process. Stakeholders can monitor the overall progress, identify trends, and analyze historical data. Customizable reports and visualizations provide insights into process performance, enabling continuous improvements.

By incorporating these additional features, EQSM ensures that stakeholders have real-time visibility into the e-commerce business process. It enables them to make informed decisions, take timely actions, and address any delays or issues proactively.
